        <p>
            Subhas Chandra Bose (23 January 1897 – 18 August
            1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many
            Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by
            authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. The honorific Netaji (Bengali: "Respected Leader")
            was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the
            German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.

            Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj.
            The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian
            Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the
            routine final exam, citing nationalism as a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the
            nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to
            leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to
            socialism. Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between
            him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely
            states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude
            to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself. After the large majority of the Congress
            Working Committee members resigned in protest, Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from
            the party.
            <br><br>

            In April 1941 Bose arrived in Nazi Germany, where the leadership offered unexpected but equivocal sympathy
            for India's independence. German funds were employed to open a Free India Centre in Berlin. A
            3,000-strong Free India Legion was recruited from among Indian POWs captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps
            to serve under Bose. Although peripheral to their main goals, the Germans inconclusively considered a
            land invasion of India throughout 1941. By the spring of 1942, the German army was mired in Russia and Bose
            became keen to move to southeast Asia, where Japan had just won quick victories. Adolf Hitler during his
            only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 offered to arrange a submarine. During this time, Bose became a
            father; his wife, or companion, Emilie Schenkl, gave birth to a baby girl.
            Identifying strongly with the Axis powers, Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943. Off
            Madagascar, he was transferred to a Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in
            May 1943
            <br><br>
            With Japanese support, Bose revamped the Indian National Army (INA), which comprised Indian prisoners of war
            of the British Indian army who had been captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore. A
            Provisional Government of Free India was declared on the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands and
            was nominally presided by Bose. Although Bose was unusually driven and charismatic, the Japanese
            considered him to be militarily unskilled, and his soldierly effort was short-lived. In late 1944 and
            early 1945, the British Indian Army reversed the Japanese attack on India. Almost half of the Japanese
            forces and fully half of the participating INA contingent were killed. The remaining INA was driven
            down the Malay Peninsula and surrendered with the recapture of Singapore. Bose chose to escape to Manchuria
            to seek a future in the Soviet Union which he believed to have turned anti-British. He died from
            third-degree burns received when his overloaded plane crashed in Japanese Taiwan on August 18, 1945. Some
            Indians did not believe that the crash had occurred, expecting Bose to return to secure India's
            independence. The Indian National Congress, the main instrument of Indian nationalism, praised
            Bose's patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology. The British Raj, never
            seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers with treason in the INA trials, but eventually
            backtracked in the face of opposition by the Congress, and a new mood in Britain for rapid decolonisation
            in India.
            <br><br>
            Bose's legacy is mixed. Among many in India, he is seen as a hero, his saga serving as a would-be
            counterpoise to the many actions of regeneration, negotiation, and reconciliation over a quarter-century
            through which the independence of India was achieved. His collaborations with Japanese Fascism
            and Nazism pose serious ethical dilemmas, especially his reluctance to publicly criticize the worst
            excesses of German anti-Semitism from 1938 onwards or to offer refuge in India to its victims.
